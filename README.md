# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wishes to create a web-based game that operates on multiple platforms and is based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It. The first requirement is already stated as needing to be fully functional on across operating platforms. Additional requirements are memory and power to support storing the images, the team information, and all code functionalities. The system also must be able to generate new images, render them within a time limit, while keeping a running score accessible to all teams at any given time. 

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think an aspect of this assignment was completing the table of operating platforms, comparing the development requirements from the server side, client side, and development tools. This table became extremely important as it provides an accessible overview of the similarities and differences between operating systems. The client may not understand all of the technical explanations. But in this format, they could easily see which system performed the best in different categories, and could judge which system worked best based on budget, team size, requirements, etc. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found the UML Diagram most helpful when designing the code. This diagram served as an illustration for technical processes. I am a visual learner; therefore, it made it easier to see physical tables representing the classes, and arrows that show the flow of information. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In choosing one part of the work to revise, I would select the recommendations. This is because I believe it could have been more detailed, solidifying a justification for the solutions, while explaining further why other solutions may not work as well. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

One of the most crucial and initial things to consider when designing an application or system, is understanding the client’s needs. This is because the client recognizes an issue that needs to be solved, which is the reason they are seeking your team. As the developer, you may find many problems that you can solve, but with limited budget and resources, the client’s prioritized problems must be solved first. If you focus on other issues, you may run out of resources before completing the client’s main issue. Furthermore, you may submit the final product, and it does not meet the clients’ requirements, resulting in major time and resource loss, with the major problem still not solved. The client may wish to remove your involvement entirely, leading to a poor reputation. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

As mentioned above, it was very beneficial to me to use a diagram. This diagram assisted me in visualizing how the software should function. In the future, I intend to utilize this tool to be sure that I understand the overall scope of the project. Also, a diagram is great for explaining your goals to the client to ensure that the entire team (client and development team) are on the same page and working toward the same goal.
